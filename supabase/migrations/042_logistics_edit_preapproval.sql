-- 042: Let Logistics dispatch pre-approved orders.
--
-- Routes Manager now lets logistics schedule ANY order that isn't out the door
-- or off the board — including draft/pending ones (v0.9.68+). But the stage
-- guard only let logistics make same-stage edits (assign a driver, set
-- route_seq / load_no, reschedule) on approved/fulfilling/ready orders, so
-- reordering or assigning a draft/pending stop was rejected by the DB and the
-- change "reverted" in the UI. Widen the logistics same-stage rule to cover
-- draft and pending too. Everything else is identical to 020. Safe to re-run.
