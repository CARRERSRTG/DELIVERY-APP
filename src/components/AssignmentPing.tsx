// ============================================================
// Raises a real phone notification when a driver is handed a stop.
//
// The in-app bell is the record; this is what actually reaches someone whose
// phone is face-down in a truck cab. It's the payoff for the notification
// permission the gate now insists on.
//
// TWO THINGS IT MUST NOT DO:
//
//  1. Replay history. Everything already on screen when the app opens is
//     marked seen first, so a driver reopening at noon isn't pinged again for
//     this morning's route.
//  2. Ping once per stop. Dispatch assigns a whole day at once; eight buzzes
//     in eight seconds is how a driver learns to ignore the app. Anything that
//     arrives together is collapsed into one.
//
// LIMIT, and it is a bigger one than "while the app is running" suggests:
// this fires only while the app is IN THE FOREGROUND. Android suspends the
// WebView's JavaScript the moment the driver switches to another app —
// measured in production, natively-captured GPS fixes sat queued for 78
// minutes until the app was reopened. Switching apps is therefore close to the
// same thing as closing it, and the buzz would land when the driver comes back
// to the app, which is exactly when they no longer need it.
//
// Reaching a phone that isn't being looked at needs push (FCM) or a native
// poller — either way, native work and a new APK. The in-app bell is the
// reliable half and always holds the record.
// ============================================================

/** Wait this long after the first new one, so a batch arrives as one buzz. */
